\section{Calculating the shot speed}

Let $u$ and $\theta$ be defined as in the worksheet.
Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity, and $x$ be the distance between the two tanks.
Assume the position of the player tank is $\colvec{0}{0}$, so the position of the enemy tank is $\colvec{x}{0}$.

The initial velocity of the projectile is
$$ \mathbf{u} = \colvec{u\cos\theta}{u\sin\theta} $$
When the projectile hits the enemy tank, its position relative to the origin is
$$ \mathbf{s} = \colvec{x}{0} $$
The acceleration on the projectile is
$$ \mathbf{a} = \colvec{0}{-g} $$

Substituting these into the equation of motion $\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{u}t + \frac12\mathbf{a}t^2$ gives
$$ \colvec{x}{0} = \colvec{u\cos\theta}{u\sin\theta} t + \frac12 \colvec{0}{-g} t^2 $$

Considering the $x$ and $y$ components separately gives two simultaneous equations:
\begin{align}
    x &= u \cos(\theta) t \tag{1} \\
    0 &= u \sin(\theta) t - \frac12 g t^2 \tag{2}
\end{align}
We have two equations in two unknowns ($u$ and $t$), so we should be able to solve this.
We want to find $u$, so let's begin by eliminating $t$.

Rearranging (1) (dividing both sides by $u \cos\theta$ gives
$$ t = \frac{x}{u \cos\theta} $$
Substituting this into (2) gives
$$ 0 = \frac{u \sin(\theta) x}{u \cos\theta} - \frac12 g \left(\frac{x}{u \cos\theta}\right)^2 $$
Cancelling $u$, squaring $\frac{x}{u \cos\theta}$ and simplifying gives
$$ 0 = \frac{x \sin\theta}{\cos\theta} - \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \cos^2 \theta} $$
Now let's rearrange this to get a formula for $u$.

Moving the second term from the right hand side to the left gives
$$ \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \cos^2 \theta} = \frac{x \sin\theta}{\cos\theta} $$
Moving $u^2$ to the right and everything else to the left gives
$$ \frac{g x^2 \cos\theta}{2 x \sin\theta \cos^2 \theta} = u^2 $$
Taking the square root and cancelling $x\cos\theta$ gives
$$ u = \sqrt{\frac{g x}{2 \sin\theta \cos \theta}} $$
Finally, applying the double angle formula for $\sin$ gives
$$ u = \sqrt{\frac{g x}{\sin 2\theta}} $$

\section{Accounting for height difference}

Assume the position of the player tank is $\colvec{0}{0}$, and the position of the enemy tank is $\colvec{x}{y}$.
Now $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ are as in Task 1, but we now have
$$ \mathbf{s} = \colvec{x}{0} $$

Again substituting into $\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{u}t + \frac12\mathbf{a}t^2$ gives
$$ \colvec{x}{y} = \colvec{u\cos\theta}{u\sin\theta} t + \frac12 \colvec{0}{-g} t^2 $$
which gives simultaneous equations
\begin{align}
    x &= u \cos(\theta) t \tag{1} \\
    y &= u \sin(\theta) t - \frac12 g t^2 \tag{2}
\end{align}
Just as in Task 1, rearranging (1) gives 
$$ t = \frac{x}{u \cos\theta} $$
Substituting this into (2) and simplifying as before gives
$$ y = \frac{x \sin\theta}{\cos\theta} - \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \cos^2 \theta} $$
Rearranging terms gives
$$ \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \cos^2 \theta} = \frac{x \sin\theta}{\cos\theta} - y $$
Combining the right hand side into a single fraction gives
$$ \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \cos^2 \theta} = \frac{x \sin\theta - y \cos\theta}{\cos\theta} $$
Moving $u^2$ to the right and everything else to the left gives
$$ \frac{g x^2 \cos\theta}{2 \cos^2 \theta (x \sin\theta - y \cos\theta)} = u^2 $$
Cancelling $\cos\theta$ and multiplying out the denominator gives
$$ u^2 = \frac{g x^2}{2x \sin\theta \cos\theta - 2y \cos^2\theta} $$
Applying double angle formulae gives
$$ u^2 = \frac{g x^2}{x \sin 2\theta - y (\cos 2\theta + 1)} $$
Finally, taking the square root gives
$$ u = \sqrt{\frac{g x^2}{x \sin 2\theta - y (\cos 2\theta + 1)}} $$

Note that this working is done in a coordinate system where the $y$-axis points upwards,
however in the program the $y$-axis points downwards.
We compensate for this by flipping the sign of $y$, so we have
$$ u = \sqrt{\frac{g x^2}{x \sin 2\theta + y (\cos 2\theta + 1)}} $$

\section{Accounting for wind}
We now have $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{s}$ as in the previous task, but
$$ \mathbf{a} = \colvec{w}{-g} $$

Again substituting into $\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{u}t + \frac12\mathbf{a}t^2$ gives
$$ \colvec{x}{y} = \colvec{u\cos\theta}{u\sin\theta} t + \frac12 \colvec{w}{-g} t^2 $$
which gives simultaneous equations
\begin{align}
    x &= u \cos(\theta) t + \frac12 w t^2 \tag{1} \\
    y &= u \sin(\theta) t - \frac12 g t^2 \tag{2}
\end{align}
Multiplying (1) through by $g$ and (2) through by $w$ gives
\begin{align}
    gx &= gu \cos(\theta) t + \frac12 gw t^2 \\
    wy &= wu \sin(\theta) t - \frac12 gw t^2
\end{align}
Adding both of these equations together gives
$$ gx + wy = gu \cos(\theta) t + wu \sin(\theta) t $$
(The $+\frac12 gw t^2$ and $-\frac12 gw t^2$ cancel out.)
Rearranging gives
$$ t = \frac{gx + wy}{u(g\cos\theta + w\sin\theta)} $$
To make life easier, define
$$ \alpha = \frac{gx + wy}{g\cos\theta + w\sin\theta} $$
So now 
$$ t = \frac{\alpha}{u} $$
Substituting this into (2) gives
$$ y = \frac{u \alpha \sin\theta}{u} - \frac{g \alpha^2}{2 u^2} $$
Cancelling $u$ and rearranging gives
$$ \frac{g \alpha^2}{2 u^2} = \alpha \sin\theta - y $$
Further rearranging gives
$$ \frac{g \alpha^2}{2 (\alpha \sin\theta - y)} = u^2 $$
Taking the square root gives
$$ u = \sqrt{\frac{g \alpha^2}{2 (\alpha \sin\theta - y)}} $$

At this point we could substitute $\alpha$ back in and simplify, but this form is good enough for doing the calculation.

\section{Calculating the shot angle}

Let's look at the case with no wind (as in Task 2). From there we have
$$ y = \frac{x \sin\theta}{\cos\theta} - \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \cos^2 \theta} $$
From definition of $\sec$ we have
$$ y = \frac{x \sin\theta}{\cos\theta} - \frac{g x^2 \sec^2\theta}{2 u^2} $$
Applying identities $\tan = \frac{\sin}{\cos}$ and $1 + \tan^2 = \sec^2$ gives
$$ y = x \tan\theta - \frac{g x^2 (1 + \tan^2\theta)}{2 u^2} $$
Rearranging gives
$$ \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2} \tan^2 \theta - x \tan\theta + \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2} + y = 0 $$
This is a quadratic of the form
$$ a \phi^2 + b \phi + c = 0 $$
with
\begin{align*}
    \phi &= \tan\theta \quad\text{(to be found)} \\
    a &= \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2} \\
    b &= x \\
    c &= \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2} + y
\end{align*}
Hence its solutions can be found using the quadratic formula
$$ \phi = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
So the shot angle is
$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right) $$
Note that there are two possible solutions (due to the $\pm$) --- hence there are two trajectories that hit the target.
